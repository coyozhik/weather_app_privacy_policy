    Privacy Policy
Last Updated: January 15, 2026
This Privacy Policy describes how Coyozhik Weather ("we," "our," or "the App") collects, uses, and shares information when you use our mobile application.
1. Information We Collect
To provide you with accurate weather updates, we may collect the following information:
Location Data: With your permission, we collect precise or approximate location data via GPS, Wi-Fi, or cellular towers. This is used solely to provide local weather forecasts.
Device Information: We may collect non-identifiable technical data such as your device model, operating system version, and language settings to ensure the App functions correctly.
2. How We Use Your Information
We use the collected data strictly for:
Providing and updating weather forecasts for your current location.
Improving App performance and fixing technical bugs.
Ensuring compliance with Google Play Store safety standards.
3. Third-Party Services
The App may use third-party providers to function:
Weather Data Providers: Your location coordinates may be sent to weather APIs (e.g., OpenWeatherMap, Apple WeatherKit) to retrieve forecasts. This data is usually processed anonymously.
Google Analytics/Firebase: We may use these tools to understand crash reports and general usage patterns. They do not collect personally identifiable information (PII).
4. Data Retention and Deletion
Location Data: We do not store your location history on our servers. Location data is processed in real-time and discarded.
User Control: You can revoke location access at any time through your device settings.
5. Permissions
The App will request the following permissions only when necessary:
Location Access: Required for localized weather data.
Internet Access: Required to download weather updates from the server.
6. Children’s Privacy
Our App is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.
7. Changes to This Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
